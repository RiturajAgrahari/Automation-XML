# PARSING XML
In this mini-project, i have multiple functions into it, to encode the image into
base64 encoding, creating an XML file and storing the binary image into that file,
decoding the XML file back to the image and lastly saving it into a directory.

#### # No need to install any external package.

## XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that outlines the rules
and protocols used to define, store, and share data between computer systems.
These rules simplify data exchange between websites, applications, and
databases on any network. Owing to their human and machine readability, the
parties involved in data sharing can easily read and decipher the data hidden
within XML files.

### Advantages of Using XML
Computing systems in the real world often face the problem of managing
incompatible data formats. As a result, communication and data sharing
between discrete sets of devices and databases are hampered. In such cases,
XML provides a worthwhile solution that bridges the communication gap
between enterprises.
